# 📌 AIL Day 3

## 🎯 Goal  
Build a **production-grade** food classification system using **YOLOv8’s classification head**.  

We’ll fine-tune it on the following **5 food classes**:  
- 🍕 Pizza  
- 🍗 Grilled Chicken  
- 🍣 Sushi  
- 🍦 Ice Cream  
- 🍔 Hamburger  

## 🚀 Plan  
- Prepare dataset and labels.  
- Use YOLOv8’s classification mode with pretrained weights.  
- Apply **advanced augmentation techniques** to boost performance.  
- Fine-tune and evaluate on validation data.  

## 📊 Output  
A trained model capable of classifying any image into one of the 5 classes above with **high accuracy**.
